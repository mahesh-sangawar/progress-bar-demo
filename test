Hi Guys,
Welcome to my channel Angels Mystic, my name is Parimiti

Today is an important day as a Great Indian fearsome warrior Chatrapati Shivaji maharaj was born, who not only ruled the major parts of India but also ruled and still ruling hearts of millions. He has a very special stature and is also a godly figure in Maharashtra

With this video I would like to pay tribute to one of the greatest emperor India has ever witnessed and take a moment to remember his glorified journey and contribution to the world. 

Introduction
When India was burning under barbaric attacks by the Mughals, there was oppression of women, language and temples. The Sultans had converted the whole country into a slaughterhouse, in such conditions Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj laid foundation of Maratha Empire which later on go expanded till modern day Afghanistan.
Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri  near the city of Junnar in Pune district on 6 April 1627 or 19 February 1630 to Jijabai and Shahaji Bhonsale. He was trained and educated by Dadoji Konddeo and his mother Jijabai.

From very small age he had immense knowledge of warfare and skills to excel in battlefield, at the age of 15 he persuaded commander of the Torna Fort, Inayat Khan, to hand over the possession of the fort to him. Firangoji Narsala, who held the Chakan fort professed his loyalty to Shivaji and the fort of Kondana was acquired by bribing the Adilshahi governor.
It is also said that Shivaji had surrender the forts of Kondana, Bangalore and Kandarpi to release his father Shahaji who was held by Adil Shah to contain Shivaji and until death of his father Shivaji maintained low profile and resumed his raiding after Shahaji died during hunting accident. 

His father left him 2,000 soldiers, which he converted to 10,000 and conquered more than 300 forts. He knew the importance of a good army and perfected warfare strategies. He had an intelligence unit that helped him devise tactics like the guerrilla warfare which today is used to train armies in 32 different countries.

He had laid the foundation of Indian navy by using war ships during that time and hence is also known as Father of Indian Navy.

At a time when all kingdoms were strictly sticking to their religious beliefs and doing away with others by destroying others worship places, 
Shivaji on the other hand respected all religion and build temples, mosques, churches, etc for his people.
He is falsely portrayed as to be against Muslims but the actual fact is he was only against the cruel rulers (who coincidently were all Muslims), he wanted to protect his people (all religions) from this rulers. His personal body guards were Muslims in fact 35-40% of his army was Muslims


He had 8 wifes but this doesn't portray entire picture, by the age 8 his father married him twice and later he had to marry to have good terms with the smaller kingdoms, He stood for the honor of women and made sure none were taken prisoners. Any rape or molestation was severely punished and even his closed people were not forgiven for this horrible crime.In fact, women of captured territories were also released unharmed, and with integrity.

Known as the Father of Indian Navy, Shivaji was the first to realise the importance of having a naval force, and therefore he strategically established a navy and forts at the coastline to defend the Konkan side of Maharashtra.  The Jaigad, Vijaydurg, Sindhudurg and other such forts still stand to testify his efforts and ideas.
The entry path to the main door of the forts built by Shivaji were always curved. Since the entry path was curved, it was impossible for elephant to gain speed thus ensuring the safety of the fort. The added advantage was that the enemies couldn't see the entrance from faraway.

Everyone of us heard about Great Shivaji's sword was gifted by goddess Bhawani mata and also believed that this sword was one of the reason for his success, however researchers have proved that The sword was made in Portugal and in those days Portugal was well advanced in the technology of producing sword from different metals.

Inspiring from his strategies Vietnam a small country was able to defend and win a war against the might Americans which went on for 20 years

Today its sad to see that Shivaji, who was also popular outside, was made to belong Maharashtra alone he is nowadays portrayed as Pro Hindu or Anti Muslim King and there is lot of politics played around his ideology and religion and people are misguided to believe this false beliefs 
There is a lot in Shivajiâ€™s history, his ideas, and his practice; his ideology can bring inspiring changes to your life, so please go back and study more about him, I am sure there is definitely something which will be inspiring for you all.
